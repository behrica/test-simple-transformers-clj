# test-simple-transformers-clj

An example of using the clojure python binding library
libpython-clj

https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj

with the python based simpletransformers library.

This combination offers the fastest route to use Bert and other deeplearning models from Clojure.


https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/simpletransformers

This repo contains a Dockerfile which installs :
- clojure
- anaconda python
- simpletransformers and all its dependencies

The clojure code is the one-to-one translation of the minimal start for binary classification with the RoBerta DL model.
